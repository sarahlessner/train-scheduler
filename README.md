# Train Scheduler

### Overview

A train schedule application that allows the user (administrator) to add trains to the scheduler. It incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

* When adding trains, administrators are able to submit the following:

    * Train Name
    * Destination 
    * First Train Time -- in military time
    * Frequency -- in minutes

* Administrators can remove trains they have added
